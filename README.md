## Hi, I’m Marko 👋

I build context-aware AI Assistants for business coaches.

My work focuses on systems that:
- Capture and qualify leads
- Book calls intelligently
- Handle client support with context and memory
- Integrate cleanly with CRMs and existing workflows

I’m interested in practical AI systems that replace manual admin and improve execution after interest — not demos or hype.

### What I’m working on
- CoachFlow — AI Assistants for lead capture, appointment setting, and client support
- Context-aware conversational logic and automation pipelines
- Reliable, maintainable AI workflows for service businesses

### Focus areas
- Conversational AI & agent design
- Workflow automation
- CRM & scheduling integrations
- System architecture for small teams
